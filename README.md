Platform Engineering Individual Task

Steps taken:

1-Create a simple HTML file and push to remote repository

2-Create an EC2 instance on AWS and enable SSH and HTTP

3-Enable GitHub Actions by creating a deploy.yml file with the build instructions

4-Provide secrets such as remote server address, SSH key, host name to ensure code security

Although I have completed all of the steps above, I had gotten an error regarding "Permission denied." due to some problem with the SSH key that I obtained from EC2 instance. However, I humbly believe that my approach was correct in the sense of deploying a simple web app to an EC2 instance through GitHub Actions. Instead of opting to use Docker, I wanted to use AWS to be familiar with JET's tech stack.
